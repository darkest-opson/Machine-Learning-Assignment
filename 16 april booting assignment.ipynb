    "Q1. What is boosting in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is a popular ensemble learning technique in machine learning that combines multiple weak models into a strong model. The idea is to sequentially train a set of weak models on the same dataset, where each model is trained on a modified version of the training set to correct the errors made by the previous models. In this way, boosting improves the overall accuracy of the final model by reducing the bias and variance of the individual models."

This approach ensures that the next weak model focuses more on the misclassified samples and improves its accuracy."

However, increasing the number of estimators can also increase the risk of overfitting the training data, which can lead to poor generalization performance on the test data. Therefore, the number of estimators should be chosen based on a trade-off between bias and variance, as well as the available computational resources."
