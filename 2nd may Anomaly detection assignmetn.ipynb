    "Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data points or observations that are different from the majority of the data in a dataset. The purpose of anomaly detection is to identify unusual or unexpected behavior or patterns in the data that may indicate the presence of outliers, errors, or anomalies."

The algorithm first computes the reachability distance of each data point, which measures how far a point needs to travel to reach another point with a higher density. The local reachability density of a point is then computed based on the average reachability distance of its k-nearest neighbors. Finally, the LOF score of a data point is computed by comparing its local reachability density to that of its neighbors."
