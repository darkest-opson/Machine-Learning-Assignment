    "Q1. Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    " The decision tree classifier algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by recursively splitting the training data into smaller subsets based on the features that best separate the classes. The splitting is done based on a set of rules learned from the data that maximizes the information gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of building a decision tree classifier involves selecting the best feature that splits the data into two subsets with the highest information gain. The information gain is calculated by the decrease in the entropy of the data after the split. The entropy is a measure of the impurity of the data, and it is calculated as the sum of the negative logarithm of the probabilities of the classes present in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree classifier continues to split the data into smaller subsets until the subsets are pure, meaning they contain only one class or until a stopping criterion is met. Once the decision tree is built, it can be used to make predictions by following the path from the root node to a leaf node that corresponds to the class prediction."
