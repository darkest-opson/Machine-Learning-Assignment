For example, in spam filtering, Bayes' theorem can be used to calculate the probability that an email is spam based on the words and phrases it contains."

    "The choice of Naive Bayes classifier depends on the nature of the problem and the characteristics of the data. There are three types of Naive Bayes classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes. Gaussian Naive Bayes is used for continuous data, Multinomial Naive Bayes is used for discrete data, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes is used for binary data. The choice of classifier depends on the type of data and the assumptions that can be made about the data."
