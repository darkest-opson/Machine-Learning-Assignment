In other words, the Eigenvector remains in the same span (direction) after it is transformed by the matrix A, and the corresponding Eigenvalue gives the scaling factor of the transformation.\n",

    "Eigen decomposition is a method used in linear algebra to decompose a square matrix A into a product of its Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues. It is also known as the spectral decomposition or diagonalization. The Eigenvalues give information about the scaling factor of the transformation, while the Eigenvectors give information about the direction of the transformation. The Eigen decomposition is significant in linear algebra because it helps to simplify and analyze complex systems by breaking them down into simpler components. It is also used in various applications such as data compression, image processing, and signal processing."
