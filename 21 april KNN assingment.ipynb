    "A1. The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in KNN is the way they measure distance between two points. The Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points in a Euclidean space, while the Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences between the coordinates of the two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This difference can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor, as different distance metrics may be more appropriate for different types of data. In general, the Euclidean distance metric is better suited for continuous data, while the Manhattan distance metric is better suited for categorical or ordinal data. However, this may depend on the specific problem and data being analyzed.\n"

Cross-validation involves splitting the data into training and validation sets, and testing different values of k on the validation set to determine which value of k produces the best performance. Grid search involves testing different combinations of hyperparameters, including k, to find the combination that produces the best performance.\n",

Some potential drawbacks of using KNN as a classifier or regressor include its sensitivity to irrelevant features, its computational complexity, and its tendency to be biased towards the majority class. To overcome these drawbacks, techniques such as feature selection or weighting can be used to reduce the impact of irrelevant features, and more efficient algorithms or hardware can be used to reduce computational complexity. Additionally, techniques such as oversampling or undersampling can be used to balance the class distribution and reduce bias towards the majority class."
